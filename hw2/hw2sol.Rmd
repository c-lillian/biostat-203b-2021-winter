Use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat203b-2021winter.github.io/hw/hw1/hw1.html).

```{r mimic-iv tree}
system(str_c("tree -s -L 2 ", shQuote(mimic_path)), intern = TRUE)
```

## Q1. PhysioNet credential

At this moment, you should already get credentialed on the PhysioNet. Please include a screenshot of your `Data Use Agreement for the MIMIC-IV (v0.4)`.

## Q2. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. Is there any speed difference?

**Solution**:

Using `read.csv` is extremely slow compared to `read_csv` and `fread`. `read_csv` and `fread` are similar in speed on my computer, with `fread` being a bit faster. 

```{r Q2}

# setting working directory to the core directory in the mimic-iv dataset
setwd(paste0(mimic_path,"/core"))


system.time({ read.csv("admissions.csv.gz") })

system.time({ read_csv("admissions.csv.gz") })

system.time({ fread("admissions.csv.gz") })


```

In this homework, we stick to the tidyverse. 

## Q3. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. Summarize following variables using appropriate numerics or graphs:   

- how many unique `stay_id`?  
- how many unique `subject_id`?  
- length of ICU stay  
- first ICU unit  
- last ICU unit  

**Solution**:

There are 69,619 unique `stay_id` values and 50,048 unique `subject_id` values.

I created a variable `stay_length` to represent the length of each ICU stay, and found the difference between `outtime` and `intime` in days. An analysis of the distribution of `stay_length` showed that the data has extreme positive skew, so I applied a log transformation to rectify that and used the log transform of `stay_length`, `log.stay_length`, for the subsequent graphical visualization.

```{r Q3 Analysis, include = F, eval = T}
# Zhou prefers graphs

# setting working directory to the icu directory in the mimic-iv dataset
setwd(paste0(mimic_path, "/icu"))


icustays <- fread("icustays.csv.gz")

icustays <- icustays %>%
  mutate_all(na_if, "")
  

### numerics

# unique stay_id
length(unique(icustays$stay_id))

icustays %>% 
  distinct(stay_id) %>% 
  nrow()

# unique subject_id
length(unique(icustays$subject_id))

icustays %>% 
  distinct(subject_id) %>% 
  nrow()

### analysis

## length of ICU stay
q3 <- icustays %>% 
  mutate(log.los = log(los))

# qqplot of los shows extreme skew

## Q4. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `ADMISSION.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. Summarize following variables using appropriate graphs. Explain any patterns you observe.   

- admission year  
- admission month  
- admission month day  
- admission week day  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- number of deaths in each year  
- admission type  
- number of admissions per patient  
- admission location  
- discharge location  
- insurance  
- language  
- martial status  
- ethnicity  
- death 

Note it is possible that one patient (uniquely identified by the `SUBJECT_ID`) is admitted into hospital multiple times. When summarizing some demographic information, it makes sense to summarize based on unique patients. 

**Solution**:

Demographics (insurance, language, marital status, ethnicity) were summarized based on unique patients since these are usually consistent over time. Death was described using `hospital_expire_flag`, which is recorded per hospital stay, so only unique `subject_id` within `admission` data was used to describe death.

```{r Q4 Cleaning/Analysis, include = F, eval = T}

# summarize using best graph/stuff according to data type (continuous vs categorical etc)

# setting working directory to the core directory in the mimic-iv dataset

For admission year, there is a steep increase in admissions starting around 2115 and number of admissions stay consistently high from 2130-2185, from where it begins to drop off steeply. The distribution is slightly positively skewed.
```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
# admityear
ggplot(data = q4.all, mapping = aes(admityear)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, col = "gray40", fill = "gray90") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Admissions",
       title = "Number of Admissions by Year")
```

Admissions per month seem to follow the pattern of having more admissions in months that are longer (Jan, March, May, July, August, October, December all have 31 days); there is a noticeable drop in admissions for February, which has 28 (sometimes 29) days in its month. There were the highest number of admissions in August and the lowest number of admissions in February.
```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
# admitmonth
ggplot(data = q4.all_admitmonth, mapping = aes(x = admitmonth, y = n)) +
  geom_point(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1:12, 
           y = count_amonth + 200, 
           label = as.character(count_amonth), size = 3) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Jan.", "Feb.", "Mar.", "Apr.", 
                              "May", "June", "July", "Aug.", 
                              "Sept.", "Oct.", "Nov.", "Dec.")) +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Number of Admissions",
       title = "Number of Admissions by Month")
```
The number of admissions by day of the month is consistently high for calendar days 1-28, which makes sense since all months have at least 28 days. The numbers start dropping off as more months don't contain that day in their respective months.

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
# admitmonthday
ggplot(data = q4.all_admitmonthday, mapping = aes(x = admitmonthday, y = n)) +
  geom_point(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Day of the Month", y = "Number of Admissions",
       title = "Number of Admissions by Day of the Month")
```
Admissions seem to be higher on the weekends, with the highest number of admissions being on Saturday and the second highest number of admissions being on Sunday. Weekdays have comparatively lower numbers of admissions.

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
# admitwday
ggplot(data = q4.all_admitwday, mapping = aes(x = admitwday, y = n)) +
  geom_point(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
    annotate(geom = "text", x = 1:7, 
           y = count_awday + 50, 
           label = as.character(count_awday), size = 3) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", 
                              "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")) +
  labs(x = "Weekday", y = "Number of Admissions",
       title = "Number of Admissions by Weekday")
```
There seems to be a trend of having less admissions during the early morning hours, and admissions slowly increase from 9am and stays consistently high until the later hours of the day. There is an unusual peak at 0 hours recorded (midnight) that looks very different from the overall distribution -- this could be attributed to not recording the time of admission and arbitrarily assigning a midnight admission time to some patients.

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
# admithour
ggplot(data = q4.all, mapping = aes(admithour)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=24, col = "gray40", fill = "gray90") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Hour", y = "Number of Admissions",
       title = "Number of Admissions by Hour of Day (Military Time)")
```
The number of deaths by year has a slight positive skew in its distribution. There is a steep increase prior to 2130, and from 2130 to 2185 the deaths stay consistently high until the deaths start dropping off slowly. This mirrors the distribution for admission year, so it seems like the number of deaths by year seems to reflect similar proportions to number of admissions by year.

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
# deathyear
ggplot(data = q4.all, mapping = aes(admityear)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, col = "gray40", fill = "gray90") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Deaths",
       title = "Number of Deaths by Year")
```
The most frequent type of admission was EW EMER. (158,032), and the least frequent type of admission was AMBULATORY OBSERVATION (7,259).

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1:9, 
           y = count_atype + 6000, 
           label = as.character(count_atype), size = 3) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, angle = 90), 
        legend.position = "right",

       title = "Number of Admissions by Type")
```
Most patients had only 1 admission, and anything past 2 admissions was considered an outlier. One patient had up to 238 admissions. The graph is extremely right skewed since most patients were in the hospital less than 2 times, as can be seen in the summary statistics produced.

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
# number of admissions per patient
print("Summary of Number of Admissions per Patient")
summary(q4.all_admitsperpt$n)

  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Number of Admissions", y = "Number of Patients",
       title = "Number of Admissions Associated with Unique Patients")
```

60,437 patients did not have data for their admission location. Of the patients that had data for their admission location, the most frequent admission location was the emergency room (246,241) and the least frequent was through ambulatory surgery transfer (191). Separate from the missing data for admission location, 379 patients had their admission data marked as `INFO NOT AVAILABLE`.

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

127,183 patients did not have data for their discharge location. Of the admitted patients that had discharge location data, the most common discharge location for patients was at home (222,298) and the least common discharge location for patients was at a healthcare facility. The data marks 9,257 unique patients as having died.

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

```
The insurance data at this hospital were coded as three different categories: `Medicaid`, `Medicare`, or `Other`. `Medicaid` was the least common insurance type (22,809), `Medicare` was the 2nd least common (60,221), and `Other` was the most common insurance type (174,336).

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

  theme(legend.position = "right") + 
  labs(x = "Insurance", y = "Count",
       title = "Insurance Types of Admitted Patients")
```
The data for language was only recorded as two values: `English` or `?`, which is not extremely informative. Of the unique admitted patients, 238,387 patients were marked as English-speaking and 18,979 were marked with `?`.

```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(x = "Language", y = "Count",
       title = "Languages of Admitted Patients")

Marital status data was unavailable for 63,866 of the unique admitted patients. Of the data that were available, the majority of patients identified as either married (84,946) or single (78,458). Patients that identified as divorced were least frequent, with only 12,259 patients identifying as such.
```{r Q4 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

The majority of the unique admitted patients at this hospital identified as being white (159,642). There were 3,132 patients whose ethnicities were unable to be obtained, and 16,593 patients whose ethnicity was unknown. Olny 951 of admitted patients identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, the smallest category of all ethnicity categories.

## Q5. `patient` data

Explore `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/patients/>) and summarize following variables using appropriate numerics and graphs:  

- `gender`  
- `anchor_age` (explain pattern you see)

**Solution**:

I decided to analyze `gender` using only unique patients (unique `subject_id`) because demographic data does not change per patient. I analyzed `anchor_age` using all patients (not selecting for unique `subject_id`) because the patient's age at admission can change per hospital/ICU admission.

```{r Q5 Analysis, include = F, eval = T}
# setting working directory to the core directory in the mimic-iv dataset
setwd(paste0(mimic_path, "/core"))

patients <- read_csv("patients.csv.gz")

patients <- patients %>%
  mutate_all(na_if, "")

q5_all <- patients

q5_unique <- patients %>% 
  distinct(subject_id, .keep_all = T)

# summarizing gender
q5_gender <- q5_unique %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  count() %>%
  mutate(pct = round((100*n/nrow(q5_unique)), digits = 2))

count_gender <- t(q5_gender$n)
values_gender <- t(q5_gender$gender)

# summarizing anchor_age
q5_anchor_age<- q5_all %>% 
  group_by(anchor_age) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

```

More unique female patients (52.25%) were recorded than male patients (47.75%).

`anchor_age` is supposed to represent the age of the patient during the `anchor_year` listed for that same patient. However, the values of `anchor_age` seem off because there is a significant peak of over 60,000 entries where the entered `anchor_age` for a patient was equal to 0. This is a sign that there might be anomalies in data collection or unclear coding of data from the hospital system's end (maybe the patient's age at admission was coded 0 for unknown or underage). 
```{r Q5 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

# gender
ggplot(data = q5_gender, mapping = aes(x = gender, y = pct)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = gender)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  theme_minimal() +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1:2, 
           y = q5_gender$pct + 2, 
           label = paste0(as.character(q5_gender$pct), "%"), size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Percent (%)",
       title = "Gender of Admitted Patients")

# anchor_age
ggplot(data = q5_all, mapping = aes(anchor_age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, col = "gray40", fill = "gray90") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Count",
       title = "Patient Ages at Hospital Admission")

```


## Q6. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. 

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), glucose (50931), magnesium (50960), calcium (50893), and lactate (50813). Find the `itemid`s of these lab measurements from `d_labitems.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.

**Solution**:

First take a look at first few lines of the `labevents.csv.gz`. `read_csv` doesn't work (memory issues) even with reading only selected columns.
#change
```{r, eval = F}
system(str_c("zcat < ", shQuote(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz")), 
             " | head"), intern = T)
```

Reading data using data.table. Since `labevents.csv.gz` is so large, only the relevant columns are chosen in order to read in the data. 
```{r Q6 reading in labevents}

transactFile <- str_c(mimic_path,"/hosp/labevents.csv.gz")
chunkSize <- 1000
con <- file(description= transactFile, open="r")
data <- read.table(con, nrows=chunkSize, header=T, fill=TRUE, sep=",")
close(con)

if(!file.exists("labevents_icustays.csv.gz")){
 system.time(labevents <- 
        fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz"),
           select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id",
                      "itemid", "charttime", "valuenum"), 
           nThread = 4))
 labevents %>%
  semi_join(icustays, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  fwrite("labevents_icustays.csv.gz", nThread = 4)
}
system.time(labevents <- fread("labevents_icustays.csv.gz"))
labevents %>%
 as_tibble() %>%
 print(width = Inf)

```


```{r Q6}

# LAB MEASUREMENT (ITEMID)
# creatinine (50912)
# potassium (50971)

v_labevents <- c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 
                 51301, 50931, 50960, 50893, 50813)
q6 <- labevents %>%

## Q7. Vitals from chartered events

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate.

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `ITEMID` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `VALUE` variable is the value measured for `ITEMID`. 

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `ITEMID` in `CHARTEVENTS.csv`. Find potential values of `ITEMID` that correspond to systolic blood pressure, i.e., `LABEL` contains the string `systolic`. 

**Solution**:

There are over 327 million rows in `chartevents.csv.gz`. This was determined by running the following command in bash.
```{bash, eval = F}
system(str_c("zcat < ", shQuote(str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/chartevents.csv.gz")), 
             " | wc -l"), intern = T)
```


```{bash}
# reproducible code for turning in the assignment
zcat < "/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv/icu/chartevents.csv.gz" | 
  awk -F, '{if ($6 == 220045 || $6 == 220050 || $6 == 220052 || 
  $6 == 220179 || $6 == 220181 || $6 == 220210 || $6 == 223761 || $6 == 220277) 
  print $1, $2, $3, $4, $6, $8} {OFS = ","}' | gzip > q7chartevents.csv.gz

```

I ran the following code locally to download and filter the dataset within Git Bash on my own WindowsOS machine:
```{bash, eval = F}

# downloading data to my own machine:
scp -r lchen121@server.ucla-biostat-203b.com:/usr/203b-data/mimic-iv-derived-data d/

# filtering on my local machine using the shell command:
zcat < "/d/mimic-iv-0.4/mimic-iv-0.4/icu/chartevents.csv.gz" | 
  awk -F, '{if ($6 == 220045 || $6 == 220050 || $6 == 220052 || 
  $6 == 220179 || $6 == 220181 || $6 == 220210 || $6 == 223761 || $6 == 220277) 
  print $1, $2, $3, $4, $6, $8} {OFS = ","}' | gzip > q7chartevents.csv.gz

# transferring my filtered chart events back to the teaching server
# scp filename username@server.ucla-biostat-203b.com:fullpathtohwfolder
scp q7chartevents.csv.gz lchen121@server.ucla-biostat-203b.com:
/home/lchen121/biostat-203b-2021-winter/hw2/

```


```{r Q7 reading in chartevents filtered}

if(!file.exists("chartevents_icustays.csv.gz")){
 system.time(chartevents <- 
        fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/q7chartevents.csv.gz"),
           nThread = 4))
 names(chartevents) <- c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "stay_id", 
                         "charttime", "itemid", "valuenum")
 chartevents %>%
  semi_join(icustays, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "stay_id")) %>%
  fwrite("chartevents_icustays.csv.gz", nThread = 4)
}
system.time(chartevents <- fread("chartevents_icustays.csv.gz"))
chartevents %>%
 as_tibble() %>%
 print(width = Inf)

```


I ran a chunk of 2000 lines to see if I could find all the requested vitals within this initial chunk. Looking through the item dictionary for `chartevents.csv.gz`, 8 different itemids were identified as the requested vitals to keep from this dataset.
```{r Q7, eval = F}

transactFile <- str_c(mimic_path,"/icu/d_items.csv.gz")
chunkSize <- 2000
con <- file(description= transactFile, open="r")
data <- read.table(con, nrows=chunkSize, header=T, fill=TRUE, sep=",")
close(con)

# CHART EVENT (ITEMID LABEL)
# heart rate (220045 Heart Rate)

# mean bp (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined) 
# (220052 Arterial Blood Pressure mean) 
# (220181 Non Invasive Blood Pressure mean)

# systolic bp (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined) 
# (220050 Arterial Blood Pressure systolic)
# (220179 Non Invasive Blood Pressure systolic) 

# body temperature (choose only one since we are doing linear regression)
# (223761 Temperature Fahrenheit) 

# SpO2 [(229862 Forehead SpO2 Sensor In Place) - what Dr. Zhou used]
# (220277 O2 saturation pulseoxymetry) - what I used

# respiratory rate 
# (220210 Respiratory Rate)

v_chartevents <- c(220045, 220052, 220181, 220050, 
                   220179, 223761, 229862, 220210)

# chartevents already has the itemids listed in v_chartevents, so the vector
# will not be used

q7 <- chartevents %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  #force charttime to be datetime
  mutate(charttime = ymd_hms(charttime)) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
  
```



## Q8. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble for all ICU stays, where rows are  

- first ICU stay of each unique patient  
- adults (age at admission > 18)  

and columns contains at least following variables  

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz` 
- all variables in `patients.csv.gz`
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  
- first vitals measurement during ICU stay  
- an indicator variable whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission  #30 day mortality Y/N variable

**Solution**:

First, remove excess variables from the global environment to ease memory:
```{r}
rm(list = ls(pattern = "q4"))
rm(list = ls(pattern = "values"))
rm(list = ls(pattern = "count"))

```

The final merged table is labeled as `q8full` and contains all desired variables from `admissions`, `icustays`, `patients`, `labevents`, `chartevents`.
