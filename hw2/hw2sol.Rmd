Use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic-iv.mit.edu) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat203b-2021winter.github.io/hw/hw1/hw1.html).

```{r mimic-iv tree}
system(str_c("tree -s -L 2 ", shQuote(mimic_path)), intern = TRUE)
```

## Q1. PhysioNet credential

At this moment, you should already get credentialed on the PhysioNet. Please include a screenshot of your `Data Use Agreement for the MIMIC-IV (v0.4)`.

## Q2. `read.csv` (base R) vs `read_csv` (tidyverse) vs `fread` (data.table)

There are quite a few utilities in R for reading data files. Let us test the speed of reading a moderate sized compressed csv file, `admissions.csv.gz`, by three programs: `read.csv` in base R, `read_csv` in tidyverse, and `fread` in the popular data.table package. Is there any speed difference?

**Solution**:

Using `read.csv` is extremely slow compared to `read_csv` and `fread`. `read_csv` and `fread` are similar in speed on my computer, with `fread` being a bit faster. 

```{r Q2}

# setting working directory to the core directory in the mimic-iv dataset
setwd(paste0(mimic_path,"/core"))


system.time({ read.csv("admissions.csv.gz") })

system.time({ read_csv("admissions.csv.gz") })

system.time({ fread("admissions.csv.gz") })


```

In this homework, we stick to the tidyverse. 

## Q3. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. Summarize following variables using appropriate numerics or graphs:   

- how many unique `stay_id`?  
- how many unique `subject_id`?  
- length of ICU stay  
- first ICU unit  
- last ICU unit  

**Solution**:

There are 69,619 unique `stay_id` values and 50,048 unique `subject_id` values.

I created a variable `stay_length` to represent the length of each ICU stay, and found the difference between `outtime` and `intime` in days. An analysis of the distribution of `stay_length` showed that the data has extreme positive skew, so I applied a log transformation to rectify that and used the log transform of `stay_length`, `log.stay_length`, for the subsequent graphical visualization.

```{r Q3 Analysis, include = F, eval = T}
# Zhou prefers graphs

# setting working directory to the icu directory in the mimic-iv dataset
setwd(paste0(mimic_path, "/icu"))


icustays <- fread("icustays.csv.gz")

icustays <- icustays %>%
  mutate_all(na_if, "")
  

### numerics

# unique stay_id
length(unique(icustays$stay_id))

icustays %>% 
  distinct(stay_id) %>% 
  nrow()

# unique subject_id
length(unique(icustays$subject_id))

icustays %>% 
  distinct(subject_id) %>% 
  nrow()

### analysis

## length of ICU stay
q3 <- icustays %>% 
  mutate(log.los = log(los))

# qqplot of los shows extreme skew
ggplot(data = q3) +

## Q4. `admission` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `ADMISSION.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. Summarize following variables using appropriate graphs. Explain any patterns you observe.   

- admission year  
- admission month  
- admission month day  
- admission week day  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- number of deaths in each year  
- admission type  
- number of admissions per patient  
- admission location  
- discharge location  
- insurance  
- language  
- martial status  
- ethnicity  
- death 

Note it is possible that one patient (uniquely identified by the `SUBJECT_ID`) is admitted into hospital multiple times. When summarizing some demographic information, it makes sense to summarize based on unique patients. 

**Solution**:
Demographics (insurance, language, marital status, ethnicity) were summarized based on unique patients since these are usually consistent over time. Death was described using `hospital_expire_flag`, which is recorded per hospital stay, so all `admission` data was used to describe death.

```{r Q4 Cleaning/Analysis, include = F, eval = T}

# summarize using best graph/stuff according to data type (continuous vs categorical etc)

# setting working directory to the core directory in the mimic-iv dataset
setwd(paste0(mimic_path, "/core"))

## Q5. `patient` data

Explore `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/core/patients/>) and summarize following variables using appropriate numerics and graphs:  

- `gender`  
- `anchor_age` (explain pattern you see)

**Solution**:

I decided to analyze `gender` using only unique patients (unique `subject_id`) because demographic data does not change per patient. I analyzed `anchor_age` using all patients (not selecting for unique `subject_id`) because the patient's age at admission can change per hospital/ICU admission.

```{r Q5 Analysis, include = F, eval = T}
# setting working directory to the core directory in the mimic-iv dataset
setwd(paste0(mimic_path, "/core"))

patients <- read_csv("patients.csv.gz")

patients <- patients %>%
  mutate_all(na_if, "")

q5_all <- patients

q5_unique <- patients %>% 
  distinct(subject_id, .keep_all = T)

# summarizing gender
q5_gender <- q5_unique %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  count() %>%
  mutate(pct = round((100*n/nrow(q5_unique)), digits = 2))

count_gender <- t(q5_gender$n)
values_gender <- t(q5_gender$gender)

# summarizing anchor_age
q5_anchor_age<- q5_all %>% 
  group_by(anchor_age) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())

```


The values of `anchor_age` seem off because there is a significant peak of over 60,000 entries where the entered `anchor_age` for a patient was equal to 0. This is a sign that there might be anomalies in data collection or unclear coding of data from the hospital system's end (maybe the patient's age at admission was coded 0 for unknown or underage). 

```{r Q5 Graphs, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}

# gender
ggplot(data = q5_gender, mapping = aes(x = gender, y = pct)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = gender)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  theme_minimal() +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 1:2, 
           y = q5_gender$pct + 2, 
           label = paste0(as.character(q5_gender$pct), "%"), size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Percent (%)",
       title = "Gender of Admitted Patients")

# anchor_age
ggplot(data = q5_all, mapping = aes(anchor_age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, col = "gray40", fill = "gray90") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Age (years)", y = "Count",
       title = "Patient Ages at Hospital Admission")

## Q6. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. 

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), glucose (50931), magnesium (50960), calcium (50893), and lactate (50813). Find the `itemid`s of these lab measurements from `d_labitems.csv.gz` and retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` only containing these items.

**Solution**:

First take a look at first few lines of the `labevents.csv.gz`. `read_csv` doesn't work (memory issues) even with reading only selected columns.
```{r}
system(str_c("zcat < ", shQuote(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz")), 
             " | head"), intern = T)
```

Reading data using data.table.
```{r Q6 reading in labevents}

transactFile <- str_c(mimic_path,"/hosp/labevents.csv.gz")
chunkSize <- 1000
con <- file(description= transactFile, open="r")
data <- read.table(con, nrows=chunkSize, header=T, fill=TRUE, sep=",")
close(con)

if(!file.exists("labevents_icustays.csv.gz")){
 system.time(labevents <- 
        fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/hosp/labevents.csv.gz"),
           select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "itemid", 
                 "charttime", "valuenum"), 
           nThread = 4))
 labevents %>%
  semi_join(icustays, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  fwrite("labevents_icustays.csv.gz", nThread = 4)
}
system.time(labevents <- fread("labevents_icustays.csv.gz"))
labevents %>%
 as_tibble() %>%
 print(width = Inf)

```


```{r Q6}

# LAB MEASUREMENT (ITEMID)
# creatinine (50912)
# potassium (50971)

                        51221, 51301, 50931, 50960, 50893, 50813))

## Q7. Vitals from chartered events

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate, mean and systolic blood pressure (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined), body temperature, SpO2, and respiratory rate.

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `ITEMID` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `VALUE` variable is the value measured for `ITEMID`. 

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic-iv.mit.edu/docs/datasets/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `ITEMID` in `CHARTEVENTS.csv`. Find potential values of `ITEMID` that correspond to systolic blood pressure, i.e., `LABEL` contains the string `systolic`. 

**Solution**:

```{r Q7 reading in chartevents, eval = F}


if(!file.exists("chartevents_icustays.csv.gz")){
 system.time(chartevents <- 
        fread(str_c(mimic_path, "/icu/chartevents.csv.gz"),
           select = c("subject_id", "hadm_id", "itemid", 
                 "charttime", "valuenum"), 
           nThread = 4))
 chartevents %>%
  semi_join(icustays, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  fwrite("chartevents_icustays.csv.gz", nThread = 4)
}
system.time(chartevents <- fread("chartevents_icustays.csv.gz"))
chartevents %>%
 as_tibble() %>%
 print(width = Inf)

```


```{r Q7, eval = F}

transactFile <- str_c(mimic_path,"/icu/d_items.csv.gz")
chunkSize <- 2000
con <- file(description= transactFile, open="r")
data <- read.table(con, nrows=chunkSize, header=T, fill=TRUE, sep=",")
close(con)

# mean bp (invasive and noninvasive measurements combined) 
# (220052 Arterial Blood Pressure mean) 
# (220061 Pulmonary Artery Pressure mean)

   filter(itemid %in% c(220045, 220052, 220061, 220181, 220050, 
                        220059, 220179, 223761, 223762, 220277, 220210))

## Q8. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble for all ICU stays, where rows are  

- first ICU stay of each unique patient  
- adults (age at admission > 18)  

and columns contains at least following variables  

- all variables in `icustays.csv.gz`  
- all variables in `admission.csv.gz` 
- all variables in `patients.csv.gz`
- first lab measurements during ICU stay  
- first vitals measurement during ICU stay  
- an indicator variable whether the patient died within 30 days of hospital admission  #30 day mortality Y/N variable

```{r Q8, eval = F}

firstlab <- q6 %>%
  group_by(subject_id, hadm_id) %>% 
  slice_min(charttime)

firstvitals <- q7 %>%
  group_by(subject_id, hadm_id) %>% 
  slice_min(charttime)

q8 <- icustays %>% 
  group_by(subject_id) %>% 
  slice_min(intime) %>% 
  # merge admissions data
  left_join(admissions, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>% 
  # merge patients data
  left_join(patients, by = "subject_id") %>% 
  mutate(admitage = year(admittime) - anchor_year + anchor_age) %>% 
  filter(admitage >= 18) %>%
  # merge firstlab data
  left_join(firstlab, by= "subject_id", "hadm_id") %>%
  # merge firstvitals data
  left_join(firstvitals, by= "subject_id", "hadm_id") %>%
  # create indicator variable whether pt died within 30 days of admittime
  mutate(binary_death30 = if_else((!is.na(deathtime) 
                          & (difftime(deathtime, admittime, units="days") > 0) 
                          & (difftime(deathtime, admittime, units="days") < 30))
                          , 1, 0)) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
